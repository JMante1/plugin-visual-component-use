def uri_to_url(data, instance, spoofed_instance):
    """
    Change the instance that is being refered to in the data to the instance
    given by instance if the current instance
    they are referencing is the spoofed_instance

    Requirements
    -------
    import pandas as pd

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pandas series OR string
        The input with urls that must be changed. The cells/string should
        containg string(s) of the format:
        'https://something_to_be_replaced/something_to_keep'
    instance : string
        the synbiohub instance where information is to be retrieved from
        e.g. 'https://synbiohub.org/' (note it must have the https:// and
        the / at the start/end)
    spoofed_instance : string
        the synbiohub instance that it is pretending to be
        e.g. 'https://dev.synbiohub.org/' pretends to be
        'https://synbiohub.org/'

    Returns
    -------
    data: pandas series OR string
        The df column/string with uris converted to urls of the format:
        'instance something_to_keep',
        e.g. 'https://synbiohub.org/someting_to_keep'

    Example
    --------
    import pandas as pd

    lst = ['https://shouldnt_change.org/public/igem/BBa_E1010/1',
        'https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_C0051/1',
       'https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_C0040/1']
    series = pd.Series(lst)

    new_series = uri_to_url(series, 'https://dev.synbiohub.org/',
                'https://synbiohub.org/')

    Output:
